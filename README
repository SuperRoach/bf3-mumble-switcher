Battle murmur/mumble switcher.

This is intended to be for server operaters, who have a murmur instance running.

It requires ICE to be installed on your murmur instance. For information on how to do this, please use:
http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Ice

Once that is all active, test out the sample scripts you have with your Mumble to see that it's working ok.

With that all good, put my php file up on a instance that has murmur on the server, and then access it from the web. 

Change the testusername 

Todo:
- Grab users for a single channel instead of globally
- Hardcode a list of mumble usernames/battlelog id's to move forward
- Battlelog json parsing (per user most likely)
