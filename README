Battle murmur/mumble switcher.

This is intended to be for server operaters, who have a murmur instance running.

It requires ICE to be installed on your murmur instance. For information on how to do this, please use:
http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Ice

Once that is all active, test out the sample scripts you have with your Mumble to see that it's working ok.

With that all good, put my php file up on a instance that has murmur on the server, and then access it from the web. 

	Running the script:
You can use this with cron to run as often as you would like.
	/usr/bin/wget --quiet "http://yourserverlocation.com/samplecreation.php?email=YOURBATTLELOG@EMAIL.COM&password=YOURPASS"    
Note the need to specify your battlelog email and password, which is needed to access the API itself.

Change the $testusername if you want to enforce that to only work for yourself. There are a few variables near the start you can change.

	
Todo:
- Grab users for a single channel instead of globally 
- Hardcode a list of mumble usernames/battlelog id's to move forward  (done)
- Battlelog json parsing (per user most likely)  (done)
- Make channels be removed when they are empty (temp flag isn't implemented in murmur yet, will need to work around)
